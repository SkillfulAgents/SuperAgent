description: Detect drift in the Claude system prompt that agent-container sends to Anthropic. Captures two axes — the bare `claude_code` preset (Anthropic baseline) and agent-container's fully custom wire request — at the SDK version pinned in `agent-container/package-lock.json`, then stores versioned snapshots in `<skill>/snapshots/` (gitignored). Because SuperAgent REPLACES the preset with its own system prompt, preset drift never reaches our sessions automatically — every pure-claude change must be triaged for porting into system-prompt.md. Use when bumping `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, debugging unexpected model behavior after an SDK upgrade, previewing what a PR changes in the on-wire prompt, or auditing what Anthropic silently changed in the Claude Code preset.

# Claude Prompt Drift Check

Capture + diff of the `/v1/messages` request body that `claude-agent-sdk` emits, at two layers:

| Axis          | What it captures                                                                              |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pure-claude` | Bare `{ type: 'preset', preset: 'claude_code' }` baseline — no MCP, no append, no custom tools |
| `superagent`  | What `agent-container` actually puts on the wire (skills, MCP, claudeMd, etc.)                |

**Key architectural fact:** `claude-code.ts` passes `systemPrompt` as a plain string (rendered from `agent-container/src/system-prompt.md`), which REPLACES the `claude_code` preset entirely — the preset never reaches our sessions. Our prompt is a separate, parallel document covering similar ground in its own words, so when Anthropic improves the preset, our prompt silently falls behind unless someone ports the change. That protection is the point of this skill.

The interesting signal is each axis's drift *across captures*:

- `pure-claude` drift → Anthropic changed the preset. **This is never merely informational** — because we replace the preset, no preset improvement reaches our agents automatically. Run the porting triage below on every hunk.
- `superagent` drift → our own prompt/wiring changed (edited system-prompt.md, added/removed an MCP server, changed claudeMd, bumped SDK, etc.). Expected when we shipped prompt changes; a red flag when we didn't (means the SDK/CLI altered how it assembles our request).

## Porting triage (mandatory when pure-claude drifts)

For each hunk in the pure-claude `system.md` diff, decide **port / adapt / skip** against our prompt sources:

- `agent-container/src/system-prompt.md` — the main session prompt
- `agent-container/src/web-browser-agent-prompt.md`, `dashboard-builder-agent-prompt.md`, `computer-use-agent-prompt.md` — subagent prompts

Triage rules:

1. **Behavioral guidance** (tone, safety, communication, memory discipline — e.g. the 2.1.219 they/them pronoun paragraph): usually **port**, adapted to our prompt's voice and section structure. Anthropic adds these from behavioral data; our agents talk to real humans and inherit none of it.
2. **Product-surface text** (fast mode, /commands, terminal UI, Claude Code feature descriptions): **skip** — describes their product, not ours.
3. **Facts that go stale** (model rosters, model IDs, knowledge cutoffs, pricing): our main prompt deliberately carries none of these — keep it that way, but check the subagent prompts for hardcoded model IDs and route those to the `update-models` skill.
4. **Tool-description drift** (`tools.md` diff): only actionable if our prompt or subagent prompts restate guidance about that tool — check before dismissing.

Record the port/skip decision per hunk in the upgrade PR description so the next drift run doesn't re-litigate old hunks.

`snapshots/` is build output, not source. It lives next to the script so it's trivially discoverable (`ls .claude/skills/claude-prompt-drift/snapshots/`) but never enters git.

## Snapshot layout

Default location: `<this skill>/snapshots/`. Override precedence: `--snapshots-dir <path>` > `$SNAPSHOTS_DIR` env > default.

Layout under the snapshots root:

```
pure-claude/<sdk-version>/<model>/{system,messages,tools}.md + meta.json
superagent/<sa-key>/<model>/{system,messages,tools}.md + meta.json
```

`<sa-key>` shape:

| Source           | Shape                              | Example                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| main / release   | `<sdk>+<sa-version>`               | `0.2.118+0.3.24`              |
| `--pr <num>`     | `<sdk>+pr<num>-<short-sha>`        | `0.2.118+pr73-fef927c2`       |
| dirty tree       | suffix `-dirty` (needs `--allow-dirty`) | `0.2.118+0.3.24-dirty`   |

The two axes are keyed differently because they depend on different things: `pure-claude` only on the SDK version, `superagent` also on what SuperAgent ships. Mixing them in one key would silently overwrite the superagent axis when SuperAgent changes without an SDK bump.

## When to use

- After bumping `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` in `agent-container/package.json`.
- "Model is behaving weirdly since the SDK upgrade" — diff to see what shifted.
- Reviewing a PR that touches `agent-container` prompts/tools — capture the PR head and diff against main.
- Auditing whether Anthropic silently changed the `claude_code` preset.

## Prerequisites

- Docker running.
- `jq`, `curl`, `git` on PATH.
- Skill run from inside the SuperAgent repo (so `--superagent-path` can auto-resolve).

## Usage

### Capture the current SDK version (default = working tree)

```bash
cd /path/to/SuperAgent
.claude/skills/claude-prompt-drift/capture.sh
```

### Capture a PR head without touching the working tree

```bash
.claude/skills/claude-prompt-drift/capture.sh --pr 73
```

`--pr` fetches `origin/pull/<num>/head`, builds in a detached worktree, captures, removes the worktree on exit.

### Capture against an arbitrary checkout

```bash
git worktree add --detach /tmp/sa-old origin/main~10
.claude/skills/claude-prompt-drift/capture.sh --superagent-path /tmp/sa-old
git worktree remove /tmp/sa-old
```

### Flags

| Flag                    | Default                                    | Meaning                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--model`               | `claude-opus-4-7`                          | Model id (one snapshot per model)                        |
| `--axis`                | `both`                                     | `pure-claude`, `superagent`, or `both`                   |
| `--pr <num>`            | _none_                                     | Capture against a PR head (mutually exclusive with `--superagent-path`) |
| `--force`               | off                                        | Re-capture even if snapshot exists                       |
| `--allow-dirty`         | off                                        | Allow `superagent` capture from a dirty working tree. Key gets a `-dirty` suffix. |
| `--snapshots-dir`       | `$SNAPSHOTS_DIR` or `<skill>/snapshots`    | Where to write snapshots (gitignored at the default location) |
| `--superagent-path`     | _auto_                                     | Override SuperAgent repo path                            |
| `--anthropic-api-key`   | `dummy-for-capture`                        | API key passed to the containers. Proxy captures the request body **before** forwarding upstream, so a 401 is fine. Claude Code's CLI does light local validation — pass a real-looking key if it complains. |

### Diff two snapshots

```bash
.claude/skills/claude-prompt-drift/diff.sh pure-claude <old-sdk> <new-sdk>
.claude/skills/claude-prompt-drift/diff.sh superagent  <old-key> <new-key>
```

Exits non-zero on drift (CI-friendly). Diff is per-axis on purpose — the two axes have different key shapes.

## What the between-axes diff means

In a single capture, `pure-claude/<sdk>/<model>/system.md` and `superagent/<key>/<model>/system.md` are two unrelated documents — the preset vs our full replacement prompt (~80 vs ~700 lines, different section structure). Diffing them line-by-line is meaningless and is not what this skill is for. This skill tracks how each axis evolves over time; the pure axis exists purely as the canary for preset changes to feed the porting triage above.

## Noise handling

`proxy.mjs` redacts two volatile fields before writing the rendered `.md`:

- The capture timestamp is dropped from `.md` (it lives in `meta.json`).
- `cch=<hex>` in the billing header (system[0]) is replaced with `cch=<redacted>`. Claude Code regenerates this per request even for identical input, so leaving it raw makes every diff flap.

Real signal fields like `cc_version=...` and `cc_entrypoint=` are kept.

## Notes

- One capture per `(axis, key, model)` is intentional — captures are large and the static prefix is stable per session. Use `--force` to redo.
- `raw.json` and `.seen-models.json` are produced during capture but excluded from diffs.
- `pure-baseline/run.mjs` uses the SDK that's already installed inside the agent-container image (no separate `npm install`), avoiding the glibc/musl mismatch that broke earlier attempts at running the baseline under `node:20-alpine`.
- Working tree state matters. When pointing at the working repo directly, the script reads `git rev-parse HEAD` and `git status --porcelain` — make sure that's what you mean to capture (typically `origin/main` or a PR head, not a stale local branch).
- `--model` must match what agent-container actually puts on the wire. The container ignores the session's requested model and uses its own default (currently `claude-opus-4-8`); if `--model` names anything else, the proxy writes the snapshot under the real model's dir while the script polls the wrong path and times out. The pure axis honors `--model` via the `DRIFT_MODEL` env var.
- Windows/Git Bash: capture.sh disables MSYS path conversion for container-side docker args (`MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL`) and renders host mount paths via `cygpath -m` — required, or the `-v` mounts get rewritten to `C:\Program Files\Git\...` and the proxy crash-loops. Needs `jq` on PATH (not bundled with Git for Windows).

## Known caveat: local build ≠ GHCR image

`capture.sh` runs `docker build ./agent-container` locally each invocation; it does **not** pull `ghcr.io/skillfulagents/superagent-agent-container-base:<sha>` (the image users actually run). The two are not byte-identical — different base-image digest resolution, `npm install` transitive-dep timing, build-cache state — so for a strict bit-for-bit integrity audit this skill is not the right tool.

For wire-prompt drift, this is acceptable: `system` / `tools` / `messages` content all originate in `agent-container/src/` (system-prompt.md, MCP registrations, `claude-code.ts` tool wiring), which both the local build and CI bake in the same way. If a finding ever looks suspicious, re-check by pulling the GHCR image at the same SHA and inspecting out-of-band — but the common case doesn't require it.

CI only publishes the base image on push to `main` (see `.github/workflows/build-container.yml`), so for PR captures local build is the only option regardless.
